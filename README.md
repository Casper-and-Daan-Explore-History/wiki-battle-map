Welcome to WikiExplore, a project created by [Casper Kessels](https://www.casperkessels.com) and [Daan van Rasmhorst](https://daan.vanramshor.st) that aims to revolutionize the way users navigate through Wikipedia articles. Our project is now live at [wikiexplore.org](https://wikiexplore.org).

At WikiExplore, we understand that sometimes users want to explore Wikipedia articles based on their geographic locations. That's why we've designed a beautiful map that allows users to do just that! By simply clicking on any location on the map, users will be redirected to the corresponding Wikipedia article for that location.

But that's not all! We also wanted to enhance users' experiences by linking them to Wikidata, Wikipedia, and Wikimedia commons for photos. By doing this, users will have access to a vast amount of information and images that will make their explorations more enjoyable and informative.

One of the exciting features of WikiExplore is that we randomly select the starting location on earth from any city above 100000 population, with countries capped at 50 cities. This ensures that users will have a unique and exciting experience each time they use our platform.

To make the user experience even better, we also provide an image and text preview for any selection made on the map. This preview gives users a glimpse of what they can expect to see in the corresponding Wikipedia article, helping them decide whether to explore further or not.

We're thrilled to share this project with you and hope that you'll find it as exciting and useful as we do. So come on and join us on this adventure of exploring the world through Wikipedia articles!
