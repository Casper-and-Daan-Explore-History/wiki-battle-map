Welcome to WikiExplore, a project created by [Casper Kessels](https://www.casperkessels.com) and [Daan van Rasmhorst](https://daan.vanramshor.st) that aims to revolutionize the way users navigate through Wikipedia articles. Our project is now live at [wikiexplore.org](https://wikiexplore.org).

At WikiExplore, we understand that sometimes users want to explore Wikipedia articles based on their geographic locations. That's why we've designed a beautiful map that allows users to do just that! By simply clicking on any location on the map, users will be redirected to the corresponding Wikipedia article for that location.

But that's not all! We also wanted to enhance users' experiences by linking them to Wikidata, Wikipedia, and Wikimedia commons for photos. By doing this, users will have access to a vast amount of information and images that will make their explorations more enjoyable and informative.

One of the exciting features of WikiExplore is that we randomly select the starting location on earth from any city above 100000 population, with countries capped at 50 cities. This ensures that users will have a unique and exciting experience each time they use our platform.

To make the user experience even better, we also provide an image and text preview for any selection made on the map. This preview gives users a glimpse of what they can expect to see in the corresponding Wikipedia article, helping them decide whether to explore further or not.

We're thrilled to share this project with you and hope that you'll find it as exciting and useful as we do. So come on and join us on this adventure of exploring the world through Wikipedia articles!

Using WikiExplore is simple: just navigate to the website and the map will open at a random location. From there, you can click on any point on the map to see a preview of the Wikipedia article associated with that location. The preview includes an image, the first few paragraphs of the article, and links to Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, Wikipedia, Google Maps, and Google Search.

What sets WikiExplore apart is its focus on serendipity. Instead of searching for specific topics or locations, users can discover new and interesting articles simply by exploring the map. It's a great way to broaden your knowledge and expand your horizons.

In addition to the map, WikiExplore also features a contextual menu that appears when you click the right button on the map. This menu offers a list of links to other map services, providing even more opportunities for discovery and exploration.
